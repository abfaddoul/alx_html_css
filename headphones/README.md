# 🎧 Headphones Landing Page

This project is part of the **ALX Front-End Program**.  
The goal is to build a responsive, accessible, and pixel-perfect web page **based on a Figma design**, using **only HTML and CSS**.

## 🚀 Objective

- Reproduce the exact layout and styles provided in the Figma file.
- No CSS frameworks or JavaScript (except for the last part).
- Must be fully responsive (switch layout for screens smaller than 480px).
- Use semantic HTML and well-structured CSS.

## 🎨 Design Reference

- The original design was created by **Nicolas Philippot (UI/UX Designer)**.
- Figma file was duplicated into drafts for inspection and usage.

## 📐 Guidelines

- Use fonts: `Source Sans Pro` and `Spin Cycle OT`

  - [Spin Cycle OT](https://www.dafontfree.net/freefonts-spin-cycle-ot-f122609.htm)

- Max width of content: **1000px**, centered.
- When screen width is **≤ 480px**, switch to mobile layout.
- Hover/active styles:
  - Links: `#FF6565`
  - Buttons: `opacity: 0.9`
