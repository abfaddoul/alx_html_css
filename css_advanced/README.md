## 🔍 Overview

- Styling based on a Figma design
- Responsive layout

## 📁 Files

- `index.html`: Main HTML file based on the advanced HTML structure

- `images/`: Contains all required assets (logos, icons, backgrounds, etc.)

## 🧑‍🎨 Figma Design

You can view and duplicate the Figma file here:

👉 [Open in Figma](#) *(replace with real link)*  
Don’t forget to **"Duplicate to your Drafts"** for full access.

### Fonts Used:
